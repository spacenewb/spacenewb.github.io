Hi, I'm Hariharan! I'm a space engineer with degrees in Aeronautical Engineering and Space Engineering. I'm passionate about sharing and learning new things, experimenting with new concepts, and scientific computation. That's why I've started this blog - to share some interesting concepts, works, ideas, and even projects that I undertake.

Through my academic and professional journey, I've gained a deep understanding of aeronautical and space engineering principles, and I'm excited to share my knowledge and ideas with others. I believe that science and engineering should be accessible to everyone, and I hope that my blog can help demystify some of the complexities of these fields.

Whether you're interested in space exploration, scientific computation, or just learning something new, I hope that you'll find something valuable on my blog. So, join me on this journey of exploration and discovery!
